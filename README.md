# MiniChatApp

This is my draft of a test assignment for an interview. Tools used in this project include:

**ReactJS (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer);**
**Immutable JS**
**React-Window (This is an improved version of React-virtualized)**

## The finished application can be viewed at this address:

### The project implements an adaptive version of this application.
### The login form remembers the user and saves him to **localStorage**
